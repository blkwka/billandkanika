      <h1>Project Scope</h1>
      <p>Our project focuses on developing an cutting edge mobile application game as a way of solving the widespread
        difficulties related to type 1 diabetes in our local community. More than just providing entertainment, our main
        goal is to spread important awareness about the daily challenges faced by people with diabetes. Our goal in
        creating this app is to create a unique and powerful resource that will not only amuse our intended audience but
        also act as a guide for increasing awareness as well as comprehension among members of our community.</p>
      <h2>insuLIN</h2>
      <p>Our app, InsuLIN, is intended to serve as a educational tool that provides information on the eating habits
        decisions, physical activity habits, and difference that exists between carbohydrates and protein consumption
        and insulin dosage in managing diabetes. Through their interaction with our app, we hope that users will not
        only collect a deep understanding of how to deal with the difficulties presented by diabetes but also encourage
        independence and well-informed decision making in our community.</p>
      <h2>Engagement</h2>
      <p>The primary goal of the app's strategic design is to engage a younger audience, specifically those under the
        age of 18. We strive to accommodate the teaching styles of our children because we recognize the difficulties
        that come with lengthy papers or complex passages. A researcher named Louisa Rosenheck at MIT’s Education Arcade
        Lab stated “What’s really motivating about a good learning game is the learning,”. Our strategy makes sure that
        crucial data about type 1 diabetes is not only available to but also enjoyable for our younger users by
        utilizing the power of game development. We recognize that using a game to teach medical knowledge creates a
        more interactive and exciting learning environment, which helps kids learn and remember critical information
        about managing their diabetes. This customized strategy improves the effectiveness of our community awareness
        campaign while simultaneously meeting the specific needs of our target market.</p>

          <p>I am a senior in high school with a passion for art and a deep interest in computer
            science. My academic journey has included a range of computer science courses, from game development to AP
            Computer Science A. I enjoy the learning process of discovering new skills. Using these talents, I often
            help my teachers/professors in film, editing, and sound projects in my school. With four years of experience
            in Blender and proficiency in Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Unity, I'm adept at creating visually
            stunning content. Additionally, I'm learning the world of 2D animation and animation rules in OpenToonz. I'm
            pursuing my dream of mastering the piano in my spare time, I feel as if music is the key to the heart and
            soul and the piano has been an instrument that really spoke out to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Artists like Hayao Miyazaki and Alain Goraguer inspire me, and I aspire to create 2D animated films in the
            near future that reflect my dedication to this artistic expression. I see my future as a blend of these two
            passions, where I can leverage my technical skills in computer science and also work to bring my artistic
            visions to life. My goal is to continue growing in both fields and eventually make a mark in the world of 2D
            animated filmmaking, showcasing the skills and creativity I've honed through years of hard work and
            dedication.</p>

          <p>As a highly driven high school student with a passion for technology, I have dedicated countless hours to
            honing my skills in the field of computer science. Proficient in multiple coding languages, including
            Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Java, I possess a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving.
            My commitment to excellence in computer science has been recognized through accolades such as the NCWIT and
            FBLA Computer Applications awards, where I showcased my ability to leverage technology for practical
            applications. I have challenged myself with rigorous coursework including; AP Computer Science A and AP
            Computer Science Principles.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond coding, I have expanded my skill set to include proficiency in various Adobe applications and the
            Microsoft suite, allowing me to integrate design and productivity tools seamlessly into my projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am eager to collaborate with industry professionals, learn from experienced mentors, and explore
            opportunities that align with my passion for technology. As I continue to pursue my dreams, I am excited to
            connect with like-minded individuals and organizations to share knowledge and create a brighter
            technological future. I also want to expand my knowledge of app development. As a diabetic myself, I am
            determined to develop an app that helps all diabetics easily manage their condition.</p>
